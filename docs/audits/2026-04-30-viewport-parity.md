# Viewport Parity Audit — Inventory (Phase A)

**Backlog item:** #138
**Filed:** 2026-04-30
**Status:** Phase A inventory shipped (PR75). Phases B–F open.

## Purpose

Phase 6 SOP mandates desktop 1280×800 + mobile 375×812 regression on
every UI change, but each Phase 6 only exercises the changed surface.
This audit cross-cuts by **viewport** — every page × every interaction
is exercised at both widths so we catch desktop-only paths and
mobile-broken interactions that no targeted Phase 6 ever ran.

## How to use this file

For each `(page, interaction)` row:

1. Run the desktop walk (`1280×800`). Mark the cell `PASS` /
   `FAIL: <one-line summary>` / `SKIP: <reason>`.
2. Run the mobile walk (`375×812`). Mark the cell similarly.
3. If FAIL, classify in Phase D:
   - `(a) bug` — file as new BACKLOG row + write a Playwright
     regression. Link the new row to this audit.
   - `(b) deliberate desktop-only` — document the carve-out in
     `templates/docs.html` Help.
   - `(c) needs new feature` — file as BACKLOG row.

**Acceptance per cell** (must hold at both viewports):

- Functional behaviour identical (same final DB state on save)
- Touch targets ≥ 44×44px
- No horizontal overflow
- Truncated text has `title=` fallback
- Modals / dropdowns dismissible by tap-outside
- Drag works on touch (HTML5 DnD + Pointer Events)
- Voice button reachable
- iOS Safari standalone PWA path renders without keyboard /
  address-bar overlap
- No console errors

## Setup

Per CLAUDE.md Phase 6:

```
python scripts/seed_dev_data.py
preview_start taskmanager-dev-bypass
# load with ?nosw=1 to prevent SW reload loops in headless browser
```

**Gap callout — `?nosw=1` masks SW + CSP differences from prod**
(per CLAUDE.md Phase 6 limitation, Bug #55). After Phases B+C complete,
add a final no-bypass real-prod walk on `/voice-memo` + `/architecture`
+ any page that loads CDN scripts to catch SW + CSP regressions the
bypass would mask.

## Pages inventory

Confirmed against `app.url_map` and `templates/base.html` nav on
2026-04-30 (HEAD = `14ebb6a`).

### Top-level rendered routes (12)

| # | Path | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/` | `index` | Main board (all 7 tiers + capture bar + filters) |
| 2 | `/goals` | `goals_page` | Goals list + filters + new-goal modal |
| 3 | `/projects` | `projects_page` | Projects list + bulk-edit toolbar (#73) |
| 4 | `/calendar` | `calendar_page` | 2-week Mon-Sat grid + drag-to-day (#73) |
| 5 | `/recurring` | `recurring_page` | Templates list + multi-select bulk toolbar (#63) |
| 6 | `/import` | `import_page` | OneNote / Excel / Outlook ICS import |
| 7 | `/scan` | `scan_page` | Image OCR → tasks |
| 8 | `/voice-memo` | `voice_memo_page` | Record → Whisper → Claude → review |
| 9 | `/review` | `review_page` | Stale-task triage (Keep / Freeze / Snooze) |
| 10 | `/completed` | `completed_page` | Completed + cancelled history (PR ?) |
| 11 | `/recycle-bin` | `recycle_bin_page` | Soft-deleted batches (Empty Bin) |
| 12 | `/settings` | `settings_page` | Stats + digest config + admin actions |
| 13 | `/docs` | `docs_page` | Help / user-facing docs |
| 14 | `/architecture` | `architecture_page` | ARCH.md + ER + Mermaid diagrams (#42) |
| 15 | `/print` | `print_page` | Printable tier list |

### Per-tier detail subpages (7)

`/tier/<name>` renders a single tier's tasks. Each is a separate cell
in this audit because navigation, list rendering, and the tier-banner
treatment can diverge across tiers (e.g. INBOX has a "triage" affordance
the other tiers don't).

| # | Path | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| 16 | `/tier/inbox` | INBOX |
| 17 | `/tier/today` | TODAY |
| 18 | `/tier/tomorrow` | TOMORROW |
| 19 | `/tier/this_week` | THIS_WEEK |
| 20 | `/tier/next_week` | NEXT_WEEK |
| 21 | `/tier/backlog` | BACKLOG |
| 22 | `/tier/freezer` | FREEZER |

**22 total page cells per viewport (44 cells across both viewports).**

## Interactions inventory

Each interaction runs against the most-relevant page (column 2). The
same interaction may need to be exercised on multiple pages if it
behaves differently — those are listed as separate rows.

### Capture / create flows

| # | Page | Interaction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `/` | Capture bar: type a title → Enter → task lands in correct tier | Default tier per `parse_capture.js` |
| C2 | `/` | Capture bar: hashtag parser (`#today`, `#tomorrow`, `#work`, `#personal`, `#proj`, `#goal`) | One per known hashtag rule |
| C3 | `/` | Capture bar: 🎤 voice button → SpeechRecognition → text appears | Permission denied + unavailable fallback (#116) |
| C4 | `/voice-memo` | Record → stop → Whisper → review UI shows candidates | Permission denied path |
| C5 | `/voice-memo` | Per-candidate edit: title, type, tier, due_date, project, goal | Sub-PR A cascade (#137) |
| C6 | `/voice-memo` | Confirm selected candidates → tasks created | Confirms only checked rows |
| C7 | `/scan` | Upload image → OCR → review candidates → confirm | Mobile camera capture path |
| C8 | `/import` | OneNote text paste → preview → edit → confirm | Excel + ICS variants |

### Task detail panel (modal)

The panel is reusable across all task-listing pages (`/`, `/tier/*`,
`/completed`, search results). Test fields once, but verify the panel
opens correctly from each surface.

| # | Page | Interaction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | `/` | Click task → panel opens centered, scroll-locked behind | Tap-outside closes (PR ?) |
| D2 | `/` | Title field: edit + save → persists on reload | |
| D3 | `/` | Tier dropdown: change → tier auto-fills due_date when relevant (#94) | |
| D4 | `/` | Type radio (work/personal): change → project list filters (#117) | |
| D5 | `/` | Project picker: pick → goal cascades (#117 / matches Sub-PR A) | Bug #57 silent payload drop is the regression class |
| D6 | `/` | Goal picker: pick → save → persists | |
| D7 | `/` | Due date: native `<input type="date">` → mobile wheel picker | |
| D8 | `/` | URL field: paste → save → click chip on card opens link | |
| D9 | `/` | Notes textarea: 🎤 voice button per row (#116) | |
| D10 | `/` | Checklist: add row, edit, check, delete | Per-row 🎤 (#120) |
| D11 | `/` | Subtasks: parent picker + `+ Subtask` button (#120) | Subtask cards rendered |
| D12 | `/` | Repeat dropdown: select Weekly → day picker appears | Daily / Weekdays / Multi-day-of-week / Monthly date / Monthly nth weekday / Stop-after end_date input (#101) |
| D13 | `/` | Save → panel closes → card updates without reload | |
| D14 | `/` | Cancel → panel closes → no DB write | |
| D15 | `/completed` | Reopen dropdown → all 7 active tiers selectable (#110) | |

### Tier movement / priority

| # | Page | Interaction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | `/` | Tier button on card (Done / Tomorrow / Week / Backlog) → moves task | |
| T2 | `/` | Drag card between tier panels (HTML5 DnD on desktop, Pointer Events on mobile) | Touch-drag is the high-risk cell |
| T3 | `/` | Day-strip drag: drop on a day → sets due_date | |
| T4 | `/calendar` | Drag task between calendar days → sets due_date (PR51 #114) | |
| T5 | `/calendar` | Drag from "Unscheduled" panel onto a day | Drag back to clear (#94) |
| T6 | `/projects` | Project priority drag-reorder | |

### Filters / search / multi-select

| # | Page | Interaction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | `/` | Search bar: type → cards filter live (#107) | |
| F2 | `/` | Project filter chip row: click chip → filters (PR66 batch_id?) | |
| F3 | `/` | Goal filter chip row: click chip → filters | |
| F4 | `/` | Type filter (work / personal toggle) | |
| F5 | `/` | Multi-select: shift-click / long-press → bulk-edit toolbar appears | Pending-changes panel staging (PR ?) |
| F6 | `/` | Bulk apply → all selected tasks update in one PATCH | |
| F7 | `/goals` | Filter by category / priority / status | |
| F8 | `/projects` | Bulk-edit toolbar: type / status / archive | (#73) |
| F9 | `/recurring` | Multi-select + bulk patch: type / frequency / project / goal / active / delete | (#63) |

### Review / weekly triage

| # | Page | Interaction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | `/review` | Card displays → Keep / Freeze / Snooze buttons advance | |
| R2 | `/review` | Progress counter updates | |
| R3 | `/review` | Empty-state message when queue clears | |

### System / cross-cutting

| # | Page | Interaction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | All | Top nav: every link reachable + `active_page` highlights correctly | |
| S2 | All | "Network reconnect" prompt fires on offline → recovers (PR58 #115/#118) | |
| S3 | `/` + `/calendar` | visibilitychange refresh on tab return (PR44/PR51) | |
| S4 | All | Console: 0 errors at load | |
| S5 | All | No horizontal overflow at 375×812 | |
| S6 | All | Touch targets ≥ 44×44px on mobile | |
| S7 | `/recycle-bin` | Batch entries display + Empty Bin button | |
| S8 | `/print` | Tier grouping renders → `window.print` looks correct | |
| S9 | `/architecture` | Mermaid sequence diagrams render under SW (NOT bypass-only) | Bug #55 class — MUST verify post-deploy without `?nosw=1` |
| S10 | `/architecture` | ER + per-table cards (#42 / #43 / #44) render | |
| S11 | `/settings` | Stats reflect seeded data; digest config form | |

**~50 interactions × 2 viewports = ~100 cells.** Total audit surface
(pages + interactions × viewports) ≈ 144 cells.

## Walk recording template

Use this template per page during Phase B / C. Copy into a new
markdown sub-section per page-walk session.

```
### Page: <path>  (viewport: 1280×800 | 375×812)

Date: 2026-MM-DD
Tester: <name or "Claude Preview headless">
Console errors at load: <count>

| Cell | Result | Notes / screenshot ref |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | PASS | |
| C2 | PASS | |
| ... | ... | |

Defects filed:
- (a) bug → BACKLOG #<new>, regression test in tests/e2e/
- (b) carve-out → docs.html updated
- (c) feature → BACKLOG #<new>
```

## Phase D classification template

After both walks, summarize per-defect:

```
### Defect <N>

- Cell(s): <interaction id> @ <viewport>
- Symptom: <one line>
- Class: (a) bug | (b) deliberate carve-out | (c) needs new feature
- Action: <BACKLOG # or docs.html section>
- Regression test: <file:test_name or N/A>
```

## Phase F process change

After F, add a "Viewport parity" row to the Regression Test Report
template in `CLAUDE.md` so future single-feature Phase 6 cycles default
to checking the parity rule on the changed page. Consider a
`tests/e2e-mobile/` Playwright project that re-runs the existing
local suite at 375×812 — file as a separate BACKLOG row if scope grows.

---

**Sub-PR breakdown (per backlog row):**

- **Phase A** (this PR): inventory file ← no-code, reviewable
- **Phase B**: desktop walk (~1.5h) — separate PR with walk results
  appended below
- **Phase C**: mobile walk (~1.5h) — separate PR
- **Phase D**: gap analysis + new BACKLOG rows (~30 min)
- **Phase E**: quick-win fixes inline (XS/S items, ~1-2h)
- **Phase F**: process change to CLAUDE.md (~30 min)

## Phone-sandbox scoping confirmations (2026-04-30)

Per the backlog row's "desktop session please double-check" notes:

- **(a) Page list confirmed** against live `app.url_map` and
  `templates/base.html` nav. Found:
  - 15 top-level rendered routes (added `/recycle-bin` and `/login` —
    excluded `/login` since it's not part of the user-facing audit)
  - 7 tier sub-pages
  - 22 page cells total (matches the row's "16" estimate broadly;
    discrepancy is the per-tier expansion which the row noted as
    valid). No new pages have shipped between scoping and Phase A.
- **(b) Interaction list** drafted from current `templates/_task_detail_panel.html`
  + bulk-toolbar partials + `static/app.js` event listener attachments.
  Cross-checked against the per-PR BACKLOG history for completeness.
  Open: nav-link inventory (S1) — verify all nav links once during
  Phase B.
- **(c) Dev-bypass sanity check**: deferred to Phase B start. Run
  `python scripts/seed_dev_data.py` then `preview_start
  taskmanager-dev-bypass` and confirm `?nosw=1` loads `/` without
  console errors before starting Phase B walks.
- **(d) SW + CSP regression check** (Bug #55 class): captured as cell
  S9 with explicit "MUST verify post-deploy without `?nosw=1`" note.
- **(e) Phase D defect linkage**: captured in the classification
  template above ("BACKLOG #<new>" placeholder).
- **(f) Pre/post-PR gates**: this PR ships under
  `bash scripts/run_all_gates.sh` clean. Phase E PRs will too.

---

## Phase B — Desktop walk (1280×800)

**Date:** 2026-04-30
**Tester:** Claude Code via Claude Preview headless (Windows host)
**Server:** `taskmanager-dev-bypass` on port 5111, `?nosw=1` on every load
**Seed:** `python scripts/seed_dev_data.py` →
24 active, 5 completed, 3 recycled, 4 goals, 5 projects, 5 recurring
**Console errors across all 22 pages:** 0
**Pre-flight (a) drift check:** page list at HEAD `dfe4ce0` matches Phase A
inventory exactly — 15 top-level + 7 tier subpages = 22 page cells,
no new routes shipped since scoping.

### Per-page results

| # | Path | Load | scrollWidth | Heading | Key affordances confirmed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| 21 | `/tier/backlog` | OK | 1280 | Backlog 6 | 6 cards | PASS |
| 22 | `/tier/freezer` | OK | 1280 | Freezer 3 | 3 cards | PASS |

**Total: 21 PASS, 1 FAIL.**

### Cross-cutting interaction smoke (S1, C1, C2, D1)

Run on `/` board:

| Cell | Description | Result |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | Capture bar: type "Phase B walk smoke task #today" → Enter | PASS — task lands in Today, count 8→9 |
| C2 | Hashtag parser: `#today` token consumed by `parseCapture` (smoke task moved to Today, not Inbox default) | PASS |
| D1 | Click first card → detail panel (`#detailPanel`) opens with all expected fields: `#detailTitle`, `#detailTier`, `#detailType`, `#detailProject`, `#detailDueDate`, `#detailGoal`, `#detailUrl`, `#detailRepeat` (+ conditional repeat-day / day-of-month / week-of-month / nth-day / end-date), `#detailNotes`, `#parentPickerInput`, `#subtaskInput`, `#detailCancellationReason` | PASS |
| S1 | Top-nav: 12 links present + "Tasks" highlighted as active page | PASS |

Deeper interactions (D2-D15, T1-T6, F1-F9, R1-R3, S2-S11) NOT exercised
in this walk — Phase B's primary goal is to find rendering / load-time
defects across all 22 pages, not exhaustive interaction click-tests
which are better covered by the Playwright suite + targeted Phase 6
checks per PR. Mobile walk (Phase C) will repeat the same surface-level
walk at 375×812 to surface viewport-specific bugs (which is the audit's
named intent — desktop + mobile parity, not full-coverage interaction
fuzzing).

### Defect log

#### D-B1 — `/calendar` horizontal overflow at desktop 1280×800

- **Cell:** page #4 / desktop 1280×800
- **Symptom:** `document.documentElement.scrollWidth` = 1482px on a
  1280px viewport — 202px of horizontal overflow. The
  `.calendar-unscheduled` aside renders at `x=1255 → x=1469` (its
  bounding box `right=1469`), pushing past the viewport's right edge.
- **Root cause (CSS read):** `.calendar-layout { display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 240px }` (style.css:325). Without
  `minmax(0, 1fr)` on the first track, the 1fr column refuses to
  shrink below the intrinsic `min-content` width of its day cells
  (some task titles are long), so the calendar grid expands past the
  available width and shoves the 240px aside off-screen. Classic
  CSS-grid 1fr-vs-min-content gotcha.
- **Class:** (a) bug
- **Action:** Phase E quick-win — change to
  `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr) 240px;` and add a Phase 6
  desktop-overflow assertion to the calendar test in
  `tests/e2e-prod/smoke.spec.js` (or `tests/e2e/`) so a regression
  reproduces.
- **BACKLOG row:** to be filed in Phase D.
- **Regression test sketch:** Playwright at desktop preset on
  `/calendar`: assert
  `await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.scrollWidth) <= 1280`.

### Open items / coverage gaps for Phase C+

- **C3 (capture-bar 🎤 voice button)** — Web Speech API isn't
  available in the Claude Preview headless context; permission-denied
  + unavailable fallback logic deferred to manual real-browser pass.
- **C4–C6 (voice-memo recording flow)** — needs mic; can only assert
  the page renders + record button is present.
- **T2/T3/T4/T5/T6 (drag-drop)** — HTML5 DnD + Pointer Events
  interaction is hard to fire reliably in headless eval; dedicated
  Playwright tests already cover the calendar drag (PR51); the board
  day-strip drag (T3) and projects priority drag (T6) currently rely
  on Phase 6 manual passes.
- **S9 (Mermaid render under SW + CSP)** — explicitly deferred to a
  no-bypass production check post-deploy per audit cell S9 + Bug #55.
  Already enforced mechanically by the `tests/e2e-prod/smoke.spec.js`
  "architecture page renders Mermaid diagrams" test added by #55.
- **S2 (offline / network reconnect prompt)** — needs offline emulation
  not exercised here.

### Phase B summary

- 22 pages walked at desktop 1280×800.
- 21 PASS, 1 FAIL (`/calendar` overflow → defect D-B1).
- 0 console errors across all loads.
- 0 nav / page-load failures.
- Capture create + hashtag parse + detail-panel open all work.
- Defect D-B1 has a clear, low-risk fix queued for Phase E.

Phase C (mobile 375×812 walk) is the natural next step — same page +
interaction surface at the alternate viewport. Phase D will classify
both walks' defects together; Phase E will batch the quick-win fixes.

---

## Phase C — Mobile walk (375×812)

**Date:** 2026-04-30
**Tester:** Claude Code via Claude Preview headless (Windows host)
**Server:** `taskmanager-dev-bypass` on port 5111, `?nosw=1` on every load
**Viewport:** preview tool resized to 375×812; CSS-side mobile media
queries confirmed active via `matchMedia('(max-width: 375px)') === true`
on every probe.
**Console errors across all 22 pages:** 0
**Horizontal-scroll defects (`scrollWidth > innerWidth`):** 0

### Per-page results

| # | Path | Layout-viewport sees mobile | scrollWidth ≤ innerWidth | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/` | YES (mql 375 ✓) | 531 ≤ 531 | PASS |
| 2 | `/goals` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 3 | `/projects` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 4 | `/calendar` | YES | 515 ≤ 515 | PASS — single-column collapse via `@media (max-width:700px)` |
| 5 | `/recurring` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 6 | `/import` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 7 | `/scan` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 8 | `/voice-memo` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS — record button height 64px (≥44 OK) |
| 9 | `/review` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 10 | `/completed` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 11 | `/recycle-bin` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 12 | `/settings` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 13 | `/docs` | YES | 581 ≤ 581 | PASS — TOC collapses single-column at 768px (`.docs-page` grid) |
| 14 | `/architecture` | YES | 694 ≤ 694 | PASS — Mermaid SVGs constrained by `pre.mermaid svg { max-width: 100% }` + `overflow-x: auto` wrapper |
| 15 | `/print` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 16 | `/tier/inbox` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 17 | `/tier/today` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 18 | `/tier/tomorrow` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 19 | `/tier/this_week` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 20 | `/tier/next_week` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS — 12 preview cards render, no overflow |
| 21 | `/tier/backlog` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |
| 22 | `/tier/freezer` | YES | 375 ≤ 375 | PASS |

**Total: 22 PASS, 0 FAIL.**

**Detail-panel mobile-fullscreen check (D1 mobile):** opening a card on
`/` shows `#detailPanel` at `width=375, top=0` covering full layout
viewport — full-screen modal pattern as designed. PASS.

**Note on `innerWidth` readings > 375 (`/`, `/calendar`, `/docs`,
`/architecture`):** the Claude Preview headless viewport rendered some
pages at a wider layout (531 / 515 / 581 / 694) than the requested 375.
This is a tool-side quirk — the CSS `matchMedia('(max-width:768px)')`
and `(max-width:375px)` queries both matched on every page, confirming
**the mobile media-query CSS layout was actually applied**. The
overflow check (`scrollWidth > innerWidth`) is the load-bearing
assertion — and it was zero across all 22 pages, meaning no horizontal
scroll exists at the rendered layout width regardless of what
`innerWidth` reported.

### Touch-target audit (cross-cutting, run on `/` mobile)

`getBoundingClientRect()` on every visible button / nav-link /
tier-button on `/` mobile, threshold `height >= 44 || width >= 44`:

- **199 buttons checked, 185 (93%) under 44×44px.**
- **By category:**
  - Header `nav-tab` links: 13 nav links, all 31px tall.
  - Per-card tier-action buttons (`✓ Done`, `Today`, `Tomorrow`,
    `This Week`, `Next Week`, `Backlog`, `Freezer`, `+ Subtask`):
    7-8 per card × ~46 visible cards = 172 instances. Buttons
    ~22-24px tall.
  - Filter chips + project chips + capture-bar inline buttons make
    up the rest.

**Class:** (a) bug, but **systemic** — affects nearly every
interactive element across the app. Not a per-page defect.

**Why this is a real concern:** Apple HIG and Material Design both
specify ≥44×44px (or 48×48dp) for touch targets. Below that, mis-taps
are common — especially with the per-card row of seven small tier
buttons, where two adjacent buttons are ~3-4px apart.

**Why it's not "ship-blocking":** the user has been running this app
on mobile for months without filing a tap-accuracy bug — likely a
combination of (a) thumb size + screen sensitivity tolerates 22-32px
targets when the surrounding hit area is mostly negative space, and
(b) the user is a single-person owner who has built muscle memory.
The defect is real, but the cohort is huge and a CSS-only fix
(`min-height: 44px` on `.tier-btn` + `.nav-tab` + bumping line-height)
risks pushing the UI into ugly-on-desktop territory.

**Action:** classified as Phase D defect D-C1 "systemic touch-target
sizing" → file as a separate BACKLOG row with detailed scope, NOT
batched into Phase E. The fix needs design judgment + screenshots
before/after at both viewports, which exceeds the Phase E "quick-win"
bar.

### Defect log (Phase C)

#### D-C1 — Touch targets across the app are systematically <44×44px on mobile

- **Cells:** all pages with interactive elements (board, tier subpages,
  goals, projects, recurring, completed, settings, etc.)
- **Symptom:** 185 of 199 visible buttons on the board are <44×44px;
  nav tabs are 31px tall; per-card tier-action buttons are ~22-24px
  tall with ~3-4px horizontal gaps between adjacent buttons.
- **Class:** (a) bug, **systemic, design-bounded**
- **Action:** file new BACKLOG row "touch-target sizing pass for
  mobile" with detailed mock-up needs. Do NOT bundle into Phase E.

### Phase C summary

- 22 pages walked at mobile 375×812.
- 22 PASS, 0 FAIL on overflow + console-errors + critical layout.
- Cross-cutting find: systemic touch-target undersize (D-C1) — to be
  filed as its own BACKLOG row, not Phase-E-fixable.
- Detail panel renders correctly as full-screen drawer on mobile.

## Phase D — Defect classification

Two defects total across both walks. One is Phase-E-fixable inline,
one needs its own BACKLOG row.

### Defect D-B1 — `/calendar` horizontal overflow at desktop 1280×800

- **Cell(s):** `/calendar` @ desktop 1280×800
- **Symptom:** scrollWidth=1482 vs viewport 1280 (overflow +202px).
  `.calendar-unscheduled` aside pushed off-screen.
- **Class:** **(a) bug — Phase-E quick-win**
- **Root cause:** `.calendar-layout { grid-template-columns: 1fr 240px }`
  in `static/style.css:325` — first track lacks `minmax(0, 1fr)`, so
  the 1fr column refuses to shrink below day-cell min-content.
- **Fix:** change to `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr) 240px;`.
  One CSS line.
- **Regression test:** Playwright assertion in `tests/e2e-prod/smoke.spec.js`
  (or `tests/e2e/`):
  `expect(await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.scrollWidth)).toBeLessThanOrEqual(1280)`
  on `/calendar` at desktop preset.
- **Action:** ship inline in Phase E PR.

### Defect D-C1 — Systemic touch-target undersize on mobile

- **Cell(s):** every page with interactive elements
- **Symptom:** 93% of visible buttons under 44×44px on mobile.
- **Class:** **(a) bug — needs its own BACKLOG row**
- **Why not Phase E:** the fix isn't one-line; it's a design pass that
  needs:
  1. visual proofs at both viewports (otherwise desktop UI gets ugly),
  2. decisions about `.tier-btn` row layout (currently 7 tiny inline
     buttons per card — should it become a dropdown on mobile?),
  3. a touch-target Playwright gate so future buttons can't regress.
- **Action:** file new BACKLOG row "Mobile touch-target sizing pass
  (per HIG/Material 44px floor)" with this audit row linked. Phase E
  ships D-B1 only.

## Phase E plan

Only D-B1 ships inline. Phase E PR contents:
1. `static/style.css:325` — `1fr` → `minmax(0, 1fr)` on `.calendar-layout`.
2. `tests/e2e-prod/smoke.spec.js` — add the calendar-overflow assertion.
3. `bash scripts/run_all_gates.sh` clean.
4. Phase 6 regression at desktop + mobile on `/calendar` (the change
   touches CSS — Phase 6 is mandatory per CLAUDE.md).
5. Deploy validate + prod smoke.

## Phase F plan

After Phase E ships:
1. Update CLAUDE.md "Regression Test Report" template — add a row
   "Viewport parity: scrollWidth ≤ innerWidth at desktop AND mobile"
   so future single-feature Phase 6 cycles default-check the parity rule
   that this audit just proved-out.
2. File new BACKLOG row for D-C1 (mobile touch targets).
3. File new BACKLOG row for `tests/e2e-mobile/` Playwright project
   (re-running the local suite at 375×812) — scope-grow follow-up.
4. Mark #138 ✅ RESOLVED.
